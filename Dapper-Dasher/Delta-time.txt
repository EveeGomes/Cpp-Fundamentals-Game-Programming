DeltaTime: time between frames
- it's an important concept as frame time varies
- it also helps on keeping movement consistent

---> DeltaTime = time since last frame

Although FPS is set using the SetTargetFPS() function, the value can't be guaranteed because it depends on the CPU.
- processes can/will strain the CPU, and
MORE strain = LOWER FPS

- also, the relationshipt of FPS and DeltaTime:
GREATER FPS = LOWER DeltaTime (ie, more frames in a given time)
LOWER FPS   = GREATER DeltaTime

- This way, to have a consistant movement while updating the character position, we should:
multiply velocity by DeltaTime
This allows the velocity to scale by DT and have the position updated by exactly the amount necessary to have a consistent
rate of FPS set in the SetTargetFPS().
This gives a movement that is independent of the frame rate!

- By using gravity, velocity as frame/time, we can use this concept and get DT as following:
GetFrameTime() function in Raylib returns the DeltaTime
- velocity is pixel/frame, but we can have it pixel per time instead:
so if we have 
velocity = 60 (pixel/s), we could get the DeltaTime as:
float dT = GetFrameTime();
- then, to update the position:
posY += velocity * dT;
By multiplying the
