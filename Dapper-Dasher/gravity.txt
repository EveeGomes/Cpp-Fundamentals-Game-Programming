Gravity: downward force that pulls objects toward the ground
- An object in free fall gravity imparts acceleration in the object

-> acceleration: F = m*a (mass * acceleration)
			   : change in velocity over time


using gravity as a constant acceleration: g = 10(m/s)/s

time = 0 (s)			after 1s, since the velocity is changing by 10 m/s /s , the acceleraiton due to gravity changes the velocity:
velocity = 0 (m/s)		velocity = 10 (m/s)
posY = 0 (m)			posY = 10m

						after another second passed, time = 2s , as velocity is increasing by 10 m/s /s:
						velocity = 20 (m/s)
						posY = 30m

						time = 3s
						velocity = 30 (m/s)
						posY = 60m

						time = 4s
						velocity = 40 m/s
						posY = 100m -> the character falls off the grafic since 60 (in this example) is the maximum!!!
